### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcelo Avancini

I've been working with software development for more than 10 years. I've been a Staff software engineer leading teams and helping others achieve their goals.

I have years of experience with languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. I would also highlight other technologies like RabbitMQ, Kafka, PostgreSQL, the Oracle database, and many services at AWS (including EKS, ECS, RDS, etc.).

In my current initiatives, I am part of a monolith modernization using distributed system concepts, such as messaging, event-driven, API gateway, cloud-native, and tools like Kafka, Kubernetes, and AWS services.

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working at [Philips](https://www.philips.com.br/) as software architect.
